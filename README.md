## 💂 Dataset Overview

The application works with two primary datasets:

1. **calories.csv** 🔥  
   - User demographics and fitness stats.
   - Calories burned during various activities.
     
2. **exercise.csv** 🏃  
   - Exercise duration, heart rate, body temperature, etc.
     
📌 The ML model learns from these datasets to make personalized fitness predictions.
